const WHY_TEXT = "<h2>Why,What and Thanks</h2><p><b>Why</b> did we make this? Mazechess has been created as we started to create a simpler table top role playing gams (TTRPG). These type of games are games like D&D, Pathfinder and Call of Cthulhu. They are great games and lots of fun, but can be quite complicated and take a long time to play.</p><p>So we started the whole concept of Mazechess as a much faster and simpler version of a TTRPG. This game actually part of some optional rules set for the Mazechess TTRPG that we have converted to a web game/</p><p>In this game each of the pieces represents a type of character in a typical TTRPG style adventure where the King is a wizard, the bishop is a cleric, the Knight is a scout or thief and the Castle is a fighter</p><p>If you want to follow the TTRPG keep an eye on <href>mazechess.com</href></p><h2>What</h2><p><b>What</b>is Mazechess? Mazechess is a super simpler dungeon crawl challenge in which you simply need to move your chess piece (representing a dungeon crawling adventure) from A1 to H8 avoiding any obstacles</p><h2>Thanks</h2>Big thanks to the following:<ul><li>The mazechess team</li><li>Inkarnate.com (background tiles/images)</li></ul>";
