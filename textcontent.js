const CONTACT_TEXT = "<h2>WHY DID WE MAKE THIS?</h2><p>Mazechess has been created as we started to create a simpler table top role playing gams (TTRPG). These type of games are games like D&D, Pathfinder and Call of Cthulhu. They are great games and lots of fun, but can be quite complicated and take a long time to play. So we started the whole concept of Mazechess the role playing game as a much faster and simpler version of a TTRPG. This game actually an optional rules set for Mazechess TTRPG that we have converted to a web game/</p><p>In this game each of the pieces represents a type of character in a typical TTRPG style adventure where the King is a wizard, the bishop is a cleric, the Knight is a scout or thief and the Castle is a fighter</p><p>If you want to follow the TTRPG keep an eye on <href>mazechess.com</href></p>";
